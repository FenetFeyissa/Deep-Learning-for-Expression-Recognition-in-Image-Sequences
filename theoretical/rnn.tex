\section{Recurrent Neural Networks}

A conventional neural network is not able to predict what kind of event is happening at every point in a series of events. A recurrent neural networks (RNN) solves this problem. RNN are networks with loops which allow information to persist through the series of events. A RNN can be seen as copies of the same network that are  passing information from one to the next. RNNs can learn to use the past information when the relevant information and the predicted by looking recent information. However it is possible that the data with the relevant information and the predicted event have a considerably big gap, in those cases RNNs have trouble handling 'long-term dependencies' as noted by Bengio et al \cite{BengioYoshuaSimardPatrice1994LearningDifficult}.
