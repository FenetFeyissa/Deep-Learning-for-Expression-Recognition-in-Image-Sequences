\begin{acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Doctor Sergio Escalera of the Barcelona Graduate School of Mathematics at Universitat de Barcelona. Prof. Escalera  was always open and available whenever I ran into any trouble or had any question. He guided me in the right direction and gave me all his support. 

Also, I would like to thank my second thesis advidor Doctor Gholamreza Anbarjafari (Shahab) of the Intelligent Computer Vision Research Group at University of Tartu.

Other researchers

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and family for providing me with unfailing support. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
