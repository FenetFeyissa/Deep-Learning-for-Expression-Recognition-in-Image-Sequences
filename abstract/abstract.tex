A blocked emotion is one where the person is trying not to express it or tries to hide it despite feeling it. A recognition of that types of emotions is a very challenging task even for people. This thesis consists of using machine learning algorithms for recognizing blocked emotions. The thesis also considers creating a database, which would provide data for 5 basic emotions (Happiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust and Sadness). The thesis uses state of the art deep learning on multi-modal collected data (video and EGG) for automatic analysis of hidden emotion.
